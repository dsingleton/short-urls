short-urls
==========

I wrote this document in 2009 while working at [Last.fm](http://last.fm). It shows my approach to designing a [short URL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortening) system for Last.fm pages.</p>

I've published this with the hope that, despite some Last.fm specific bits, it's useful for anyone else embarking on the design of a short URL system.
